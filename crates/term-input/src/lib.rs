//! Kitty keyboard + legacy encodings, mouse, IME bridge.
//!
//! This crate is platform-agnostic: it consumes an already-translated
//! [`KeyEvent`] (Win32 VK → `Key` translation is an M1 concern living
//! elsewhere) and produces the byte sequence to write to the PTY.
//!
//! Std-only. No external dependencies — this crate must stay portable
//! and trivially testable without pulling in platform crates.
